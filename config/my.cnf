[client]
# This section applies to all MySQL client programs like `mysql`, `mysqldump`, etc.

port = 3306
# Default port used to connect to the MySQL server.
# Must match the server's port (configured under [mysqld]).

socket = /opt/mysql/mysql8.4.3/system/process.sock
# Path to the UNIX socket file used for local client-server communication.
# Ensures local clients connect through the socket instead of TCP for better performance and security.


[mysqld]
# This section defines settings for the MySQL server (mysqld process).
# These parameters affect how the database server runs, stores data, handles connections, and logs activity.

user=twp
# MySQL server will run under the 'twp' system user.
# Ensure the user 'twp' has proper permissions to access data and log directories.

port=3306
# Standard port on which MySQL listens for incoming connections.

socket=/opt/mysql/mysql8.4.3/system/process.sock
# Specifies the UNIX socket file path used for local connections.
# Important for clients on the same machine to connect without using TCP/IP.

pid-file=/opt/mysql/mysql8.4.3/system/process.pid
# Specifies the file where MySQL writes its process ID (PID) at startup.
# This file helps system tools (like `systemctl`, `service`, or monitoring tools) track the MySQL process.
# Ensure the 'system' directory exists and is writable by the MySQL user (e.g., 'twp').

datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql8.4.3/data
# Directory where MySQL stores all database files (tables, indexes, etc.)
# Make sure this directory is owned by the 'twp' user and has correct permissions.

skip-external-locking
# Disables external file locking.
# Prevents issues on some operating systems and can improve performance.

bind-address=0.0.0.0
# MySQL will listen on all network interfaces (all IP addresses).
# Needed to allow remote clients to connect. Use firewall and user access control for security.

log-error=/opt/mysql/mysql8.4.3/log/error.log
# Specifies the file where MySQL logs errors.
# Important for debugging crashes, startup issues, etc.

symbolic-links=0
# Disables symbolic link support for security reasons.
# Prevents users from creating symlinks to system files via MySQL.

sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,STRICT_ALL_TABLES
# Sets SQL behavior modes:
# - NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION: Prevents fallback to default engine if the specified one is unavailable.
# - STRICT_TRANS_TABLES: Enforces strict checking for invalid or missing values (recommended for data integrity).
# - STRICT_ALL_TABLES: Enforces strict SQL validation on all transactional tables (like InnoDB). Prevents insertion of invalid or truncated data, improving data integrity.

slow-query-log=TRUE
# Enables the slow query log.
# Useful for identifying queries that take longer than expected.

slow-query-log-file=/opt/mysql/mysql8.4.3/log/slow-query.log
# Specifies the file path to store slow query logs.

wait_timeout=604800
# Time (in seconds) that MySQL waits before closing an idle connection.
# 604800 seconds = 7 days. Useful for long-lived apps, but keep an eye on resource usage.
